# 🌌 EUT-Lab — Einstein Unified Theory Ecosystem

Welcome to **EUT-Lab**, an open-science initiative dedicated to the  
**Einstein Unified Theory (EUT)** and its supporting frameworks.  

EUT reframes physics by treating **harmonic resonance as primary reality**,  
with spacetime geometry, matter, and biological structure emerging as  
secondary stable manifestations.  

We aim to build a **reproducible ecosystem** of theory, software, and papers  
that connects mathematics, physics, and biology under one harmonic architecture.  

---

## 🔹 Core Repositories

- [**eut-core**](https://github.com/EUT-Lab/eut-core)  
  Canonical axioms, definitions, and formal structures of EUT.

- [**eut-quantum-geometry-bio**](https://github.com/EUT-Lab/eut-quantum-geometry-bio)  
  Demonstrations of harmonic geometry in biology  
  (spatial transcriptomics, connectomics, metabolic reprogramming).

- [**eut-gravwaves-ligo**](https://github.com/EUT-Lab/eut-gravwaves-ligo)  
  Gravitational-wave pipelines and predictions for LIGO O4/O5.  

- Future modules: **E8-RMFT**, **Omega**, **TTPP**, **BSD-TTPP**, **AION**.  

---

## 🚀 Mission

EUT-Lab exists to:  
- Advance the Einstein Unified Theory through open-science methods.  
- Develop **cross-disciplinary applications** spanning physics, biology, and mathematics.  
- Provide **empirical evidence** through reproducible pipelines and datasets.  
- Enable formal citation and archiving via Zenodo DOIs.  
- Share knowledge to accelerate discovery, validation, and critique.  

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

- **Short term (2025):**  
  - Finalize `eut-core` as the stable foundation.  
  - Publish initial biology and LIGO demo modules.  
  - Release reproducible pipelines with Zenodo DOIs.  

- **Medium term (2025–2026):**  
  - Expand theory modules (Omega, TTPP, BSD-TTPP, AION).  
  - Integrate EUT with experimental domains (biology + GW astronomy).  
  - Build `eut-docs` as a unified documentation hub.  

- **Long term:**  
  - Establish EUT-Lab as a recognized open-science ecosystem.  
  - Support collaborative research across multiple disciplines.  

---

## 🔗 Resources

- 📘 [Zenodo DOIs](https://zenodo.org/search?q=EUT-Lab) — archived releases  
- 🧪 Reproducible code in every repo (`src/`, `tests/`, `notebooks/`, `papers/`)  
- 📜 Citation metadata (`CITATION.cff`) in each module
