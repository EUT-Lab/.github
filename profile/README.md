# 🌌 EUT-Lab — Einstein Unified Theory Ecosystem

Welcome to **EUT-Lab**, the open-science hub for the **Einstein Unified Theory (EUT)**  
and its supporting frameworks (E8-RMFT, Omega, TTPP, BSD-TTPP, AION, and more).

EUT reframes physics by treating **harmonic resonance as primary reality**,  
with spacetime, matter, and biological structure emerging as secondary stable forms.

## 🔹 Core Repositories
- [**eut-core**](https://github.com/EUT-Lab/eut-core) — canonical axioms and foundations  
- [**eut-quantum-geometry-bio**](https://github.com/EUT-Lab/eut-quantum-geometry-bio) — biology demos  
- [**eut-gravwaves-ligo**](https://github.com/EUT-Lab/eut-gravwaves-ligo) — gravitational-wave analysis  
- More modules: Omega, TTPP, BSD-TTPP, AION (in development)

## 🚀 Mission
EUT-Lab exists to:
- Develop and share frameworks that unify physics, math, and biology  
- Provide **reproducible code + papers** alongside theory  
- Support open, citable research through Zenodo DOIs
